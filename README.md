# EPharmacyGitHub

E-Pharmacy store has been designed using java spring-boot as backend, react.js as front-end and MYSQL as database technology. This is B2C website. The two major actors are admin and customer. Our website allow customer to explore the website, add medicines to cart and proceed to checkout. Only registered customers can buy the product so anonymous user must need to register. Admin can add/delete the medicines, manage stocks, can see user details and view order history also.
